### Hey!

My name is Luke Goule.
I am a self-taught programmer specialising in C & C++, with application hacking being a key focus of a lot of my work.
I have 7-8 years experience writing code in a whole host of languages from building small Python utilities to writing game hacking frameworks from scratch to designing and implementing databases and the web software necessary to access them. User security and privacy is something I take great pride in ensuring as I consider myself to be a very private person.

You may reach me at luke.goule (at) gmail.com.
